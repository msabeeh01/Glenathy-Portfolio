        Hi there! My name is Glen Chan-Choong and I'm a third year Graphic Communications Management
        student at Toronto Metropolitan University (Formerly known as Ryerson University), pursuing a
        minor in Communications and Design. <br><br>After unearthing my heritage and claiming it as my own, I
        want to be able to not only carry the legacy my ancestors have set out for me, but to tell
        their story and, for myself, help others tell their story through various mediums however
        graphic design and photography are the ones I utilize mainly.
    </p>
